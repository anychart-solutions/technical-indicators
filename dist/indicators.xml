                <b>Description</b><p>An Adaptive Moving Average (AMA) is an indicator similar to SMA, MMA and EMA.
                AMA changes its sensitivity due to the price fluctuations. The Adaptive Moving Average
                becomes more sensitive during periods when price is moving in a certain direction and
                becomes less sensitive to price movements when it become unstable.
                </p><b>Parameters</b><p>AMA indicator parameters are: period, fast period and slow period.</p>

                <b>Description</b><p>Developed by Tushar Chande in 1995, Aroon is an indicator system that determines whether a stock is
                trending or not and how strong the trend is. 'Aroon' means 'Dawn's Early Light' in Sanskrit. Chande
                chose this name because the indicators are designed to reveal the beginning of a new trend.
                </p><p>The Aroon indicators measure the number of periods since price recorded an x-day high or low. There are
                two separate indicators: Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down. A 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a
                25-day high. A 25-day Aroon-Down measures the number of days since a 25-day low. In this sense, the
                Aroon indicators are quite different from typical momentum oscillators, which focus on price relative to
                time. Aroon is unique because it focuses on time relative to price. Chartists can use the Aroon
                indicators to spot emerging trends, identify consolidations, define correction periods and anticipate
                reversals.
                </p><b>Parameters</b><p>Aroon indicator has only one parameter: the period.</p>

                <b>Description</b><p>Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator that measures volatility. As
                with most of his indicators, Wilder designed ATR with commodities and daily prices in mind. Commodities
                are frequently more volatile than stocks. They were are often subject to gaps and limit moves, which
                occur when a commodity opens up or down its maximum allowed move for the session. A volatility formula
                based only on the high-low range would fail to capture volatility from gap or limit moves. Wilder
                created Average True Range to capture this 'missing' volatility. It is important to remember that ATR
                does not provide an indication of price direction, just volatility.
                </p><b>Parameters</b><p>Average True Range indicator has only one parameter: the period.</p>

                <b>Description</b><p>Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that is displayed as two lines (bands): one drawn above a
                simple moving average of the price and one - below. These bands move closer to the moving average when
                price volatility is low and move farther away from the moving average when price volatility increases.
                </p><b>Parameters</b><p>Bollinger Bands parameters can be adjusted. The default parameters are: 20 periods for the simple moving
                average and 2 for the standard deviations (the distance between each band and the SMA). Increasing the
                number of periods - decreases the volatility of the SMA, and decreasing their number - increases the
                volatility of the SMA. Increasing the number of standard deviations moves the bands farther away from
                the SMA, and decreasing - moves the bands closer to the SMA.</p><p>Bollinger Bands parameters are the period and the deviation.</p><b>Function</b><p>Bollinger Bands are used to determine how volatile a stock is. Stocks move between levels of high and
                low volatility, and when the Bollinger bands grip a stock, it is a sign that the stock is consolidating
                and that a breakout is inevitable. When the Bollinger bands widen, it is a sign that the stock has burst
                out into a new trend.</p>
